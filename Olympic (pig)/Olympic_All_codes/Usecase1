olympic = load '/olympic.csv' using PigStorage('\t');

Country_final = foreach olympic generate $2 as Country, $9 as total_medals;

grouped = group Country_final by Country;

final_result = foreach grouped generate group, COUNT(Country_final.total_medals)as f_count;

sort = order final_result by f_count desc;

final_count = limit sort 10;

--dump final_count;
